// There are three types of variables in JS

let x = 1; //Have block scope, cannot redeclared,

var y = 2,
  s = 3; //Most commnon, default is var if we donot declare its datatype

const z = 3; //value cannot be reassigned, must be assigned
// we cannot reassign a  cosnt array but we can change value  like array[1]="Value changed"

var und; //value is undefined
